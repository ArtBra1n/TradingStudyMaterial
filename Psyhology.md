What is trading psychology trading? Trading psychology deals with the mental and emotional state of traders. It's all about how your behavior and mindset affect your trading. It also affects your discipline and risk tolerance. Your mind plays a big role in your long-term trading success. Understanding how you feel about trading can be just as important as working on your stock market skills. Let's look at two big emotions in trading: Greed can cause a trader to stay in a position too long to try to squeeze every last penny out of it. Greed can also motivate traders to take risky and speculative positions. This most often occurs towards the end of bull markets, when speculation runs high. Fear is the opposite. This is the reason why people sell early to cut losses and avoid additional risks. Fear is common in bear markets. This may cause some traders to exit the market irrationally. Never underestimate the power of stock market psychology. Fear can turn into panic.
Emotions play a big role in your overall trading strategy. If you want to succeed, you need to master them.
